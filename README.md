This is a file sharing web application that I built using the Django web framework. It allows users to download a variety of files such as softwares, movies, and the likes that other users have uploaded. A user can also request for items which are not already available in any of the categories. This application allows for a very seamless user operation by ensuring that file uploads and requests are not duplicated or repeated.

Once the repository is downloaded onto a local computer, the app can be run with the command "python manage.py runserver", given that python is already installed on that local computer. Otherwise, follow the instructions on this page to install python on your particular operating system : https://python.org/downloads/

Finally, I'd like to say that there will be improvements to this application, as it is not where i'd like it to be yet. For example, when the application scales up, and is being used by a lot of people, the size of the files will be very large. I would like to upload all these files to the cloud at some point in the future.
